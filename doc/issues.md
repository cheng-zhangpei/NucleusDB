# NucleusDB Issue

[toc]

​	I will list some issues that NucleusDB  comes  across right now. as a personal developer, my ability is limited. I hope after all issues is solved,I can have a deeper understand of the knowledge I possess. 

### issue 1: the overflow of the channel buffer()

​		Due to the extensive use of channels in the architecture, channel buffers may overflow when the load increases significantly.How to modify the architecture to resolve the overflow issue in this scenario

###	issue 2: Inflexibility in memory processing for agents()

​		The evaluation of current agent management algorithms is highly limited, with insufficient rigor in modeling aspects such as compression methods, similarity coefficient calculations, and memory compression effectiveness. The authors propose an adaptive memory management strategy that dynamically adjusts computational parameters across multiple algorithms based on the agent's memory space state and model parameters, effectively transforming it into a “dumb memory bucket.”

​		A more intelligent and reliable memory management system is what the author aims to achieve.



### issue 3: Log-Based Snapshot Recovery and Failure Recovery in Distributed Mode()

​	   After prolonged operation, the Raft log grows indefinitely. A snapshot packages the complete state of the current database (memory indexes + all valid data) into a single file. With snapshots, nodes restarting do not need to replay millions of log entries. Instead, they first load the snapshot and then apply new logs after the snapshot, enabling rapid recovery.

### issue 4:Due to limitations in experimental conditions, testing of the timing component was not fully comprehensive.

​		The system proposes a complex clock architecture to ensure clock synchronization and causality in distributed modes. However, due to a lack of experimental validation, the system remains theoretically implemented and has not undergone sufficient testing.
